        Text1: `JuxelTech began in 2025, when three young individuals with a shared vision decided to come together and create something that would make a difference. United by a passion for technology and the desire to change the job landscape in web and mobile design and development, we set out on a clear mission: to significantly impact the future of both people and businesses, opening new doors for those who need them most.`,
        Text2: `From day one, our goal has been clear: to build a platform that not only helps businesses find the right talent but also offers individuals the opportunity to gain experience in a sector where opportunities are limited. We aim for profiles to align 100% with the needs of companies, eliminating the traditional barriers of the job market.`,
        Text3: `But our story isnâ€™t over yet. Each day, we continue to write it, driven by a vision of a more accessible, inclusive, and dynamic future. What started as an idea in our minds is now evolving into a software agency with the potential to change the course of thousands of lives. However, this is just the beginning.`,
